# Random-Quote-Machine
"[Random-Quote-Machine](https://alexgooz.github.io/Random-Quote-Machine/)" gives you a random quote from the *[Quotes on Design API](https://quotesondesign.com/api-v4-0/)*. I am also using meterial design for the visuals, I did this by following the *[Google meterial design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/)* . I made this for a freeCodeCamp challenge (Build a Random Quote Machine).

## Outline

The outline of the challenge was:
- The User can click a button to get a new random quote.
- The User can press a button to tweet out a quote.
